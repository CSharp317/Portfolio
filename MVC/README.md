#Insurance MVC ASP.NET Project

This application was made when I worked with a consulting firm that acquired a newly established insurance company. The company needed an application that would allow them to branch out into the car insurance business. Given these requirements, I created an application using ASP.NET MVC, Razor, Entity Framework, LINQ, T-SQL and C# logic. Using ASP.NET MVC rather than Web Forms gave many advantages including:

Enables the full control over the rendered HTML.

Provides clean separation of concerns(SoC).

Enables Test Driven Development (TDD).

Easy integration with JavaScript frameworks.

Following the design of stateless nature of the web.

RESTful urls that enables SEO.

No ViewState and PostBack events
