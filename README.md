The Set-Cookie HTTP response header is used to send a cookie from the server to the user agent, so the user agent can send it back to the server later. To send multiple cookies, multiple Set-Cookie headers should be sent in the same response. The use of the SameSite policy is still “experimental” and for the use case of allowing your web api to be potentially used by anyone, using a SameSite policy would not work. The abuse of this mechanism (i.e. the browser sending the cookies automatically) is what CSRF exploits. To mitigate CSRF, its important that cookies that identify the user are httponly so that in case of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS) the attacker won’t be able to steal the auth cookie. When handling the request in the server you check if the cookie and the header values are the same. If they aren’t, or they are missing, the request is rejected. This breaks things from the point of view of the attacker. Therefore, enabling Anti-forgery validation in single page applications using ASP.NET Core and Angular mitigtes CSRF. In other words, the anti-forgery token can be used to help protect your application against cross-site request forgery.
